Create a list to store the fibonacci sequence numbers
add the first 2 numbers to the list, add them to get the third
create a counter variable to be used in the while loop, that will evaluate to false to avoid an infinite loop
This counter variable will also be used to iterate through the list adding consecutive numbers
break out of loop if next number is greater than end
