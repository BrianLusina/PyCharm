Object Oriented Concepts with Python

## Classroom

A simply Python snippet on classes in Python. This is a class of Students, which inherits from the Person class which inherits from Human class. It demonstrates *inheritance* as well as *__init__* methods. Also demonstrates Class scopes.

## Ghost

Create a class Ghost

Ghost objects are instantiated without any arguments.

Ghost objects are given a random color attribute of white" or "yellow" or "purple" or "red" when instantiated

ghost = Ghost()
ghost.color  #=> "white" or "yellow" or "purple" or "red"
c# Ghost ghost = new Gost(); ghost.GetColor(); // => "white" or "yellow" or "purple" or "red"

## Ascii Converter
Write a module Converter that can take ASCII text and convert it to hexadecimal. The class should also be able to take hexadecimal and convert it to ASCII text.

Example

Converter.to_hex("Look mom, no hands")
=> "4c6f6f6b206d6f6d2c206e6f2068616e6473"

Converter.to_ascii("4c6f6f6b206d6f6d2c206e6f2068616e6473")
=> "Look mom, no hands"
