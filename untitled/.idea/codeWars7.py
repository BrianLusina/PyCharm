Implement the function unique_in_order which takes as argument a sequence and returns a list of items without any elements with the same value next to each other and preserving the original order of elements.

For example:

unique_in_order('AAAABBBCCDAABBB') == ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'A', 'B']
unique_in_order('ABBCcAD')         == ['A', 'B', 'C', 'c', 'A', 'D']

Note: If any of the arguments is not a finite number the function should return false/False instead of the sum of the arguments.

Terminal game turn function

You are creating a text-based terminal version of your favorite board game. In the board game, each turn has six steps that must happen in this order: roll the dice, move, combat, get coins, buy more health, and print status.

You are using a library that already has the functions below. Create a function named doTurn/do_turn that calls the functions in the proper order as described in the paragraph above.

- `combat`
- `buy_health`
- `get_coins`
- `print_status`
- `roll_dice`
- `move`

You get a new job working for Eggman Movers. Your first task is to write a method that will allow the admin staff to enter a personâ€™s name and return what that person's role is in the company.

You will be given an array of object literals holding the current employees of the company. You code must find the employee with the matching firstName and lastName and then return the role for that employee or if no employee is not found it should return "Does not work here!"

The array is preloaded and can be referenced using the variable employees ($employees in Ruby). It uses the following structure.

employees = [ {'first_name': "Dipper", 'last_name': "Pines", 'role': "Boss"}, ...... ]
There are no duplicate names in the array and the name passed in will be a single string with a space between the first and last name i.e. Jane Doe or just a name.
