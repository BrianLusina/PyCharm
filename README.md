# PyCharm
   
Repository for some of my simple [Python](https://www.python.org/ "Python") functions and classes containing.

Contains short sample python programs and algorithms created from the [PyCharm IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/?fromMenu). The sample functions and classes are within directories, some are within categories like *math* and *string manipulation* and others are within directories of their own.
Each directory and/or python package has a readme for more information.
