# Python Snippets
   
Repository for some of my simple [Python](https://www.python.org/ "Python") functions and snippets. The sample functions and classes are within directories, some are within categories like *math* and *string manipulation* and others are within directories of their own.

Each directory and/or python package has a readme for more information about the Python program

## Special file (documenter)

I call this special because it prints out the documentation for Python built in functions
Python has many built-in functions, and if you do not know how to use it, you can read document online or find some books. But Python has a built-in document function for every built-in functions.
Prints some Python built-in functions documents, such as abs(), int(), raw_input()

> Hint
The built-in document method is __doc__ is used
