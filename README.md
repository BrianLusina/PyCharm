# Python Snippets
   
Repository for some of my simple [Python](https://www.python.org/ "Python") functions and snippets. The sample functions and classes are within directories, some are within categories like *math* and *string manipulation* and others are within directories of their own.

Each directory and/or python package has a readme for more information about the Python program
